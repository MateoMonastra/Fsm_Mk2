# Fsm_Mk2

## This is a fsm made with the purpose that the states are not monobehaviours and they do not handle the transitions and the Agents do it.

### To implement it you must create an agent that is the brain of the fsm, this will be in charge of the transitions, that is, use the fsm and tell it to transition between states.

### Example:
